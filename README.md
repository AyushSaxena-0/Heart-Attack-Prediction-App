üíñ Heart Attack Likelihood Predictor üíñ
A user-friendly web application built by Ayush Saxena that predicts the likelihood of a heart attack based on a patient's clinical data. This tool leverages a Random Forest machine learning model to provide quick insights and is brought to life with an interactive UI created using Gradio.

üìñ About The Project
This project was created to demonstrate a practical application of machine learning in the healthcare domain. It uses the well-known Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. A Random Forest Classifier is trained on this data to learn patterns and predict whether a patient has a high or low chance of heart disease.

The primary goal is to provide an intuitive and interactive interface for users to input medical parameters and receive an instant prediction, making a complex model accessible to everyone.

‚ú® Key Features
Interactive UI: Clean and simple user interface powered by Gradio.

Real-time Predictions: Get instant results as you input data.

Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a robust Random Forest Classifier for accurate predictions.

User-Friendly Inputs: Employs sliders, dropdowns, and radio buttons for easy and error-free data entry.

Educational Tool: Serves as a great example of deploying a machine learning model as a web application.

üõ†Ô∏è Built With
This project is built with the following technologies:

Python: The core programming language.

Scikit-learn: For building and training the Random Forest model.

Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

Gradio: For creating and launching the web UI.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these simple steps to get a local copy up and running.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python (version 3.8 or newer) installed on your system.

Installation
Clone the repository

git clone [https://github.com/AyushSaxena-0/Heart-Attack-Prediction-App.git](https://github.com/AyushSaxena-0/Heart-Attack-Prediction-App.git)

Navigate to the project directory

cd Heart-Attack-Prediction-App

Install the required packages

pip install pandas scikit-learn gradio

Run the application

python HeartAttackPrediction.py

Your terminal will provide a local URL. Open it in your browser to start using the app!

üñ•Ô∏è How to Use
Once the application is running, your web browser will display the interface.

Use the sliders, radio buttons, and dropdown menus to enter the patient's clinical data.

After filling in all the fields, the prediction will be displayed instantly at the bottom.

You can also use the "Examples" at the bottom of the page to auto-fill the form with sample data.
